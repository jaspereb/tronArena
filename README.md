# tronArena
May or may not be a TRON (2 player snake) game arena.

Run the main.py file. See 'Actually Read Me' for the game rules.

The GUI should behave properly if you run it in an environment that stops pop up windows (eg a notebook or IDE), otherwise you have to manually close each GUI frame. 

## Dependencies
-matplotlib  
-numpy  
-PIL  

## ToDo
-Write ROS node wrapper for competition  
-Fix bug in bot 1 that causes it to run into it's own tail
