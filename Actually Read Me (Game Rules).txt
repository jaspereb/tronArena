Tron Arena Docs:

This program is a tron (2 player snake) game arena. It defines a game class (similar to the connect4 game) along with some helper methods. 

Seeing as we're roboticists, for the actual contest this game class will be running in a ROS node which you can read the board state from and send your moves to. 

Some implementation details:
-The board is stored as a numpy array with default size (19,25)
-Player 1 position is stored as a 1, player 2 is a 2
-The outer edge of the board is a wall, stored as 8's
-The tails are stored internally as a binary counter but are exposed in the getGameState() function as 3's
-You can use the getGameState() function to get a copy of the board with the walls, players and tails on it. Tails are both stored as 3's 
-During each move you are teleported one square either up,down,left,right. If you end up on the same square as your opponent it counts as a draw.
-The square you were previously on becomes a tail, the final square of your tail is erased
-If you hit a wall at the same move your opponent hits a tail, you are the loser
-If your bot tries to move back on itself you will hit your own tail and lose, implement your own don't-make-a-U-turn code
